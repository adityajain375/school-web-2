<h1>My Experiences</h1>
<p>Delhi Public School is the best school I have ever been in. There are a lots of activities to do and so many opportunities are given to students to prove their talent and the students always show their bet and earn those achievements. The school is also very good at sports and academics. Their are a lots of activities to do at this school. The faculty is really very good and the way of teaching of teachers is also excellent. I'm glad to study in such a good school.</p>
